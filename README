# Sharepointr

This package is designed to simplify the process of connecting to and interacting with Microsoft SharePoint sites using the Microsoft Graph API. It provides functions list sites and files already present in Sharepoint, and perform basic operations such as uploading and downloading files to SharePoint.

## Installation

You can install the package from Github using:

```R
remotes::install_github("department-for-transport-public/sharepointr")
```

## Usage

The first time you use the package, you will need to authenticate with your Microsoft account. You will be prompted to do this the first time you run any of the functions in the package. You will receive a notification in the console which provides a link to go to, and a code to enter at this link.

You may also be asked to enter your Microsoft credentials; it's fine to do this.

Once you've authenticated the first time, your credentials will be saved, and you won't need to log in again unless your credentials expire or you clear them.

## How Sharepoint is structured

To make use of the functions in this package, you will need to know how the structure of Sharepoint folders and urls works. A typical SharePoint URL looks like this:

```
https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite/Shared_Documents/yourfolder/yourfile.txt
```

In this example:

* `yourtenant` is the name of your SharePoint tenant. This is set automatically in this package and you don't need to worry about it.
* `yoursite` is the name of the SharePoint **site** you are accessing. This is the site where your files are stored.
* `Shared_Documents` is the name of the **drive** where your files are stored.
* `yourfolder/yourfile.txt` is the full **path** of the location of your file. This includes any folders below the drive, and the name of the file itself, as well as the file extension (e.g. docx or xlsx).

For all of the functions in this package, you will be asked to provide the `site`, `drive` and `path` parameters. These correspond to the `yoursite`, `Shared_Documents` and `yourfolder/yourfile.txt` parts of the URL above.

## Functions

### Helper listing functions

* `list_drives()`: Lists all drives (document libraries) in the SharePoint site you are accessing. This makes it easy to find the drive you want to work with, and troubleshoot if you're struggling.

* `list_sharepoint_objects()`: Lists all files and folders in a specified Sharepoint drive. This is useful for navigating the structure of your Sharepoint site and finding the files you want to work with. By default, it lists the contents of the root folder of the specified drive, but you can specify a subfolder by providing the `path` parameter. For example:

```
list_sharepoint_objects(site = "yoursite", drive = "Shared_Documents", path = "yourfolder")

list_sharepoint_objects(site = "yoursite", drive = "Shared_Documents", path = "yourfolder/subfolder")

```

The first example will list all files and folders in the `yourfolder` subfolder of the `Shared_Documents` drive in the `yoursite` SharePoint site. The second example will list all files and folders in the `subfolder` folder of the `yourfolder` folder in the same drive.

### File imports

These functions allow you to read in data stored in a Sharepoint file. Note that these functions will automatically download the file to a temporary location on your computer, read it in, and then delete the temporary file. This means you don't need to worry about managing temporary files yourself.

## Troubleshooting

### I'm having to repeatedly login

Usually this is accompanied by an error message saying that a file is missing; this is due to corruption of your credentials file. You can reset this by running `rm(~/.local/share/AzureR/graph_logins.json)`; you will need to log in one final time, but then your credentials should be remembered.
